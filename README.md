Distributed business logic
==========================

Ensuring 100% uptime, increased developer productivity and cross-talk amongst teams are continuing problems.

This project strives to:

  - Decouple components, e.g.: by decomposing each route, across [optionally]: programming-languages and servers
  - Provide a reliable, efficient interface for code from multiple languages to be: interpreted, compiled and run

Some advantages include increased:

  - Adaption to changing requirements
  - Fault-tolerance
  - Unit-testing ability
  - Scalability

To achieve this, a protocol is developed here, consisting of:

  - A package schema: the starting point in considering each component distributable
  - Example frameworks: distributing and consuming the packages

Currently this project is in Alpha... would welcome suggestions throughout.
